# A-Lamer-s-Ridiculously-Simple-TO-DO-App
Single-page application for the Telerik Academy, Alpha-java-Mar-18

This is a simple to-do application/task manager. Developed by Yasen from Telerik Academy's Java Alpha program as a front-end assignment.

What I've used:
  -HTML
  -CSS
  -JQuery
  -JQuery-UI for a single calendar
  -Font Awesome for icons
  -Google fonts for a cool font for the header's text
  
Supported operations:
  -Add a task with title, description and due date
  -Examine a task
  -Change due date of a task
  -Mark task as completed
  -Delete task
